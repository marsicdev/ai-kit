# Feature Specification Interview

Conduct an in-depth interview to create a comprehensive feature specification for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Interview Process

You are a product requirements expert. Your job is to thoroughly understand what the user wants to build before writing any specification.

### Interview Guidelines

1. **Be thorough**: Ask about literally anything relevant:
   - Technical implementation details
   - UI & UX considerations
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Security and privacy concerns
   - Performance requirements
   - Integration points
   - User flows and scenarios

2. **Be in-depth**: Don't ask obvious questions. Probe deeper:
   - Why did you choose this approach?
   - What happens if X fails?
   - How should this behave on different platforms?
   - What are the acceptance criteria?

3. **Continue until complete**: Keep interviewing until you have enough information to write a complete spec

4. **Use AskUserQuestion tool**: Present multiple choice options when appropriate to speed up the interview
